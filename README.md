# tasks-with-my-good-frien - a brief overview 
Not really the smartest tool in the shed if you know what I mean <br>
Even though I should've done better I wasn't really able to focus on programming in my freshmen year of high school <br>
Very sad I know <br>
Everyone is already so good at programming and I'm still a big dumbass <br>
Recovering in the 2nd year of high school isn't the easiest <br><br>
Gradually self-deprecating myself  <br>
Opening up about problems I have almost as hard as programming itself <br>
Not going to lie I had a pretty hard time doing everything on my own <br>
Not asking for help <br>
Answering incorrectly on all the c++ tests <br><br>
Greatest miracle happened to me after the quarantine <br>
I found someone from my class who would gladly teach me c++ and more about programming <br>
Variety of things created by them that impress me greatly <br>
Everything will surely change <br><br>
Yesterday I made sure to ask for more tasks <br>
Of course I'll at least try to improve <br>
Understanding c++, js, c#, python and more is my dream <br> <br>
Unforgettable journey awaits me <br>
Prepare to be amazed once I get good at programming :)<br>
